<h1 align="center">House Rules App</h1>

<p align="center">
  The <strong>House Rules App</strong> is a React-based web application that allows users to view, search, and filter game rules pulled directly from a Google Sheet. It supports caching, offers manual data refresh, and dynamically displays different icons depending on the rule type. Built with MUI for styling and responsiveness, the app includes unique features like expandable rule categories, custom icons, and support for both single and multiplayer modes.
